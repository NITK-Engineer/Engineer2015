The event tests how long one can persist solving the trickiest (and often the simplest) computer science problems thrown at them\n\nThe first round is usually a pencil and paper round where everyone is given a set of difficult questions of mathematical or logical nature and they are expected to solve them within a given time frame (usually an hour). The questions have a story around it and is fun to both read and solve those questions. The top few teams move on to the next round","subimage":""}],"list":[{"title":"","items":[""]}],"subimage":[{"title":"","link":""}]},{"name":"Rectify","link":"rectify","banner":"rectify.jpg","subdesc":[{"subtitle":"Overview","subdescription":"Marathon is an event that inculcates multiple tasks of varying difficulty covering all fields of computer science.

It provides participants an exciting and stimulating opportunity to improve one's algorithmic and coding skills. It involves interpreting and reducing the problem statement correctly- and then design on efficient algorithms to solve it. Contestants have to write working code in language of their choice as fast as possible.\nIt was witnessed some of the finest competitive programmers across the globe(including the ACM ICPC world finalists)","subimage":""}],"list":[{"title":"","items":[""]}],"subimage":[{"title":"","link":""}]},{"name":"Kode Kombat","link":"kodekombat","banner":"kodekombat.jpg","subdesc":[{"subtitle":"Overview","subdescription":"An event which decided how deeply a team can analyse, make strategies and convert all those into code.\n\nSimply put, its a combat between 2 programs. The teams are given a set of rules of a game regarding points, and under what condition a player wins etc. The teams have to come up with a strategy which will make their program win against another program.\n\nLimits are put on the team, like the size of the program and the amount of time it takes to process a move etc. Initially, there will be several rounds of games where each game will be a complete tournament. The teams have the option of changing their code in between tournaments. At the end of the rounds the one with the most number of points will win.","subimage":""}],"list":[{"title":"","items":[""]}],"subimage":[{"title":"","link":""}]},{"name":"Code Rush","link":"coderush","banner":"coderush.jpg","subdesc":[{"subtitle":"Overview","subdescription":"We invite a speaker who is fairly reputed in the field of computer science (industry or educational field).The speaker last year was the head of the hugely popular online platform CodeChef, Anup Kalbalia part of Directi.","subimage":""}],"list":[{"title":"","items":[""]}],"subimage":[{"title":"","link":""}]},{"name":"SynthEssence","link":"synthessence","banner":"synthessence.jpg","subdesc":[{"subtitle":"Overview","subdescription":"Synthessence comes with a unique twist to conventional CodeCombat, primarily focusing on Big Data Analytics.
