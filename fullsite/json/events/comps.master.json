The questions have a story around it and is fun to both read and solve those questions.

It is an individual online event. It provides participants an exciting and stimulating opportunity to improve one's algorithmic and coding skills. It involves interpreting and reducing the problem statement correctly and then design on efficient algorithms to solve it. Contestants have to write working code in language of their choice as fast as possible.\n\nIn 2014 edition, the duration of the contest was 12 hours and 1000+ participants from as many as 30 countries were a part of this grand contest. The event witnessed some of Indiaâ€™s best competitive programmers (including ACM ICPC World Finalists).
