Their sheer magnitude, beauty and utility has made them the landmarks of many a towns and cities. They not only signify strength but also a symbol of development, connecting people all over the world. Bridge building and construction is an essential part of the civil engineering discipline. The workshop shall give the participants a hand-on experience on the topic to all the pursuing civil engineers. A lecture session will be taken by the experts on CAD based Bridge design which shall be followed by fabrication and testing of the bridge model. The lecture session shall also consist of the different types of bridges existing, structural response of bridges to different types of moving loads and load calculation in various truss using a CAD model","subimage":""},{"subtitle":"Workshop Fees","subdescription":"Rs 800","subimage":""},{"subtitle":"Duration","subdescription":"1 Day","subimage":""},{"subtitle":"Workshop Schedule","subdescription":"<ul><li>Date : 8th October </li>\n<li>Time: Session 1: 9:00A.M-12:00 P.M , Session 2: 1:00P.M-6:30P.M</li>\n</ul>","subimage":""},{"subtitle":"Contact Details","subdescription":"Sanket Gawande - 8197772633","subimage":""}],"subimage":[{"title":"","link":""}],"list":[{"title":"","items":[""]}]},{"name":"Vehicle Overhauling","link":"vehicleoverhauling","banner":"vehicleoverhauling.jpg","subdesc":[{"subtitle":"Overview","subdescription":"This program is conceptualized to impart industrial work flow to students that how automobile components function, how vehicle is conceptualized, designed and manufactured.
