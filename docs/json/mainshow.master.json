The band consist a group of musicians with varied musical influences, who have come together to dish out foot tapping, soul stirring music. Lagori makes Indian music with a twist, melodic and intense and at the same time fun and energetic. Although Lagori draws influences from the flavour of each musician - ranging from Hindustani, Soul, Funk, Rock, Blues and Metal, the end result is a unique sound which at the same time has a tinge of familiarity to it. While the band uses Hindi to communicate their inspirations and message, the music is something that everyone - despite lingual differences - will understand.",
