The event tests how long one can persist solving the trickiest (and often the simplest) computer science problems thrown at them\n\nThe first round is usually a pencil and paper round where everyone is given a set of difficult questions of mathematical or logical nature and they are expected to solve them within a given time frame (usually an hour). The questions have a story around it and is fun to both read and solve those questions. The top few teams move on to the next round","subimage":""}],"subimage":[{"title":"","link":""}],"list":[{"title":"","items":[""]}]},{"name":"Rectify","link":"rectify","banner":"rectify.jpg","subdesc":[{"subtitle":"Overview","subdescription":"Rectify is an individual event which tests not only the mastery and familiarity with a\nprogramming language but also the contestants dexterity in analysing problems and \nproviding logical solutionsThe first round is a pencil and paper round where the participants are given a set of small \nsnippets of source code and the expected output.

It is an individual online event. It provides participants an exciting and stimulating opportunity to improve one's algorithmic and coding skills. It involves interpreting and reducing the problem statement correctly and then design on efficient algorithms to solve it. Contestants have to write working code in language of their choice as fast as possible.\n\nIn 2014 edition, the duration of the contest was 12 hours and 1000+ participants from as many as 30 countries were a part of this grand contest. The event witnessed some of Indiaâ€™s best competitive programmers (including ACM ICPC World Finalists). The participant who has solved the most number of questions in the least amount of time wins the event.","subimage":""}],"subimage":[{"title":"","link":""}],"list":[{"title":"","items":[""]}]},{"name":"Kode Kombat","link":"kodekombat","banner":"kodekombat.jpg","subdesc":[{"subtitle":"Overview","subdescription":"A team event where you will code and have a lot of fun doing it.

(In the first half of the form, note the fields capturing personal information and dates of immunization). You will be provided a set of images (.jpeg) of these filled forms taken through CamScanner Android application. Physical forms will also be available if needed. First task is to 'extract the fields' in these forms using Image Processing Techniques. Once, significant amount of labelled fields are extracted from the forms, the Second task would be to recognize the written text (into digital text) using Machine Learning and other Data Analysis techniques.
